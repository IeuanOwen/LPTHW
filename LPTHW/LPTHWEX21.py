# Study Drills
# 1 ~ If you arenâ€™t really sure what return does, try writing a few of your own functions and have them return some values.
# I understand return, anything on the right hand side of an '=' can be be returned and used elsewhere in the program.

# 2 ~ What you should do is try to fi gure out the normal formula that would recreate this same set of operations.
#  = FormulaByHand Fuction

# 3 ~ modify the parts of the functions. Try to change it on purpose to make another value.
# changing any of the figures being passed to the functions and stored would affect the outcome.

# 4 ~ Finally, do the inverse. Write out a simple formula and use the functions in the same way to calculate it.
