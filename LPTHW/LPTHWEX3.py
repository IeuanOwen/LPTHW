#Study drills
#1  ~ Write comments explaining each line
# Done 

#2 ~ use python as a calculator (type sums into Terminal)
# Done

#3 ~ Write a new python file to calculate something
# cba But 
#people = 4.0
#seats = 12.0
#spareseats = 12.0 - 4.0
#seatsPerPerson = 12.0 / 4.0 
#print "There are", spareseats, "chairs available"
#print "There are", seatsPerPerson, "chairs each"

#4 ~ research floating point numvers
# floating pint = decimal

#5 rewrite using floats
# done
