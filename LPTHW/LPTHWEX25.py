# Study Drills
# 1 ~ Go through each line of output when running in the shell and work out what is happening
# Done

# 2 ~ Try doing this: help(ex25) and also help(ex25.break_words). Notice how you get help for your module and how the help is those odd '"""' strings you put after each function in ex25?
# ~ Those special strings are called documentation comments and weâ€™ll be seeing more of them.
# Skipped

# 3 ~ you can use from ex25 import * to instead of typing LPTHWEX25.print_first_word. all of your functions will have been imported.
# Done

# 4 ~ break the file an look at results
